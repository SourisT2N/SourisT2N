                CSS is sadly an increasingly undervalued tool for front end
                developers, in no small part because developers find debugging
                CSS challenging. Yet, until now there's been little in depth
                published on debugging CSS. Ahmad Shadeed's book is long
                overdue, and I can't recommend it highly enough for any front
                end developer.
